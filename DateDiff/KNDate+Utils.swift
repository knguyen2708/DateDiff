         + Find days of full month difference, after removing full years
         e.g. between 20/10/1989 and 18/03/1992 there are full months: 11/1989, 12/1989, 1/1992, 2/1992
         
         + Count the days left, after removing full years and full months
         e.g. between 20/10/1989 and 18/03/1992 there are these day ranges: 21/10/1989 - 31/10/1989 and 01/03/1992 - 18/03/1992
         
         Sum up the above 3 quantities (in fact, we just keep a count, and modify it).
         Parameter checks (ie ensuring fromDate < toDate) are integrated into the flow.
